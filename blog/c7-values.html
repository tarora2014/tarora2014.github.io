      If you were to ask me what words best discribe you, I would pick: Compassionate, Creativity, Enthusiasm, Family, Justice, Self-reliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The one thing that truly defines me is my family. I would do anything I possibilicy can when I come to maily matter. They have always supported me and would truly like to see me succeed. Without my family backing me I dont think I would be able to shift.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, I would consider myself self-relianant and compassionate. This is because I always start to think about others when I should be thinking about myslef. This causes me to think about how justice is not present in society and how I can help.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those are the 6 words that I would choose to discribe my self.

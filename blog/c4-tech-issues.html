      Imagen getting offered a job at a Tech company in San Francisco. One of the very first questions you will have to ask yourself if can you afford living there? 
    </p>
    <p>
      Most would think that well I will get a good salary since San Francisco is a big city and I would be able to afford it. Well you would be wrong! There are so many established companies and more start-up's that pop up every month that you are not only competing with others for a good job but also an affordable place to live. 
    </p>
    <p>
      According to Business Insider, the average cost to rent a One-Bedroom in San Francisco was about $3,120 as of June 2014. This number is 3 times more than the National Average. This is due to so many higher paying jobs in that area and not enough space, that people are willing to pay so much for so little. Since so many well established companies hire so many people and a-lot of people want to start a company in that area, its driving out people who are not in that industry because they just cannot afford it. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The 2 of the simplest solution that some companies have started implementing are creating there own housing and to telework.
    </p>
    <p>
      First solution that big Tech companies like Facebook and Google are trying is creating their own housing for their employees. Just like colleges, those companies are creating apartment building that people could rent near to there campuses. This method is great but only big companies can afford to do this. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Second solution is letting there employees telework. Telework is working from any remote location like their home. By doing this, their employees can live farther away from there work place and using tools like Google hangout and other tools to interact with one another. 
    </p>
    <p>
      By using one of these 2 solution, the companies can help ease some pressure in the housing market in that area.

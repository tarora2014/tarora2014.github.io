      Recursion is when you call a function from itself. You take the code and make it do a set of things until a final condition is achieved and then the whole code unwinds. This style of programming uses divide and conquer algorithm where it breaks down a large problem into multiple sub-problems with similar type.

      Most problems where you use "while" or "for" loops, they can be solved by using recursion. It is not a good idea to use recursion everywhere you use a loop but they are a great way of saving computer memory.

      In the example above, we have a method called countdown which takes in an integer. The code inside the countdown method calls itself. The code will call itself by decreasing by 1 until the passed in variable is 0. This is a great and simple example of recursion.

      Having the opportunity to create my own website was an excellent experience. Even though my website is lacking content and special effects, I liked I was given the opportunity to lay a foundation that I could build on in the future.

      I personally had never written blogs before DBC or ever thought I would. I have started to realize that blogging is a great way to share your experience and a way to see if you truly understand a topic. Before blogging there were times when I though I had understood a topics like Recursion, Classes, and Hash tables but while trying to write about it I found out that even-though I knew the topic I had a hard time explaining it in words.

      I hope to continue to work on my website and improve upon it as I learn new concepts and technologies.

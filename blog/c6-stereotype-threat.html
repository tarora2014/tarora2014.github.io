      Have you ever been in a situtation where you are expected to do great or bad in a examination?
    </p>
    <p>
      Being from an Indian family, I was always expected to do really well at everything that had to with math but not so well in english or reading. Becasue of this, when I was taking examinations I would pay more attention to the math sections resulting in higher scores compared to my english section.
    </p>
    <p>
      This could be reason why I never liked english as a subject in school or college. Regardless of how I felt about any subject I was always expected get perfect scores in Math portions of all examination. This way of thinking forced me to only consider careers that used math.
    </p>
    <p>
      This stereotype helps to motivate me to do really well in all math related classes to a point where I stated enjoying math. This would be a positive side of Stereotypeing.

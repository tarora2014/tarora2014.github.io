      Dr. Anthony Gregorc came up with a model in 1984 that consider how the mind works. It provides a combination of 4 possibility to define a person's thinking style. These 4 combination are Concrete Sequential, Abstract Random, Abstract Sequential, and Concrete Random.

      After taking the test I was able to determine my style to be Abstract Sequential, which means that I am a logical person who analyses the situation and applies logic before making a decision. In a group setting I like to have my point heard. I learn best with a balance of working alone while having access to experts and in a stimulating environment. I have a hard time working with people of different views and working on the same problem multiple times. I am also not good with emotions also have time management issues.

      After finishing 3 weeks of phase 0, I can say I had the most struggle with CSS and setting up my system in that order. The way CSS was taught makes me think that it is a trial and error type of language. You just need to practice it a lot in order to get the page set-up exactly how you want it which is was a hard concept for me to understand. I also had trouble with setting up my computer. I am using Windows operating system and the example that they gave were more mac based. I had to go on-line many times in order to get my system set-up. Both problems are related to not having a clear direction or having access to reference which caused me to spend time researching for correct answers.

      After learning that I am an Abstract Sequential thinker, I need to force myself to work in a team setting where my team has different views than me. I am a debater and I try to have people see things like I do. Having the ability to think like others is something I really want to strive towards. This will also help me express my emotions better.

    <p>
      It is very important in life to ask the right questions. To do this successfully one needs to follow 4 rules.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, you should never ask a question that can be answered with a simple yes or no. According to lifehack.org any question that contains words like "would", "should", "is", "are" and "do you think" would most likely lead to a yes or no answers. You should try and ask question that use words like "who", "what", "where", "when", "how", and "why" because those words cause people to provide a bit more information in their answers than just a "yes" or "no".
    </p>
    <p>
      Second, decide what kind of a answer you want before you ask your question. Doing this will help you formulate the question in a way which would give you your desired result. For example, instead of asking "Integers vs. Floats?", you should ask "What are the similarities and differences between Integer and Float values?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, you should always read the question out loud once after writing it. This will help you to figure out if the question you asked makes sense to a person who is reading your question for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, keep the length of your questions to 1 sentence. If it takes you a paragraph to ask your question then mostly likely your audience has lost their interest and is not listening to you. If you keep your question concise this gives the person you are asking the question to some time to think about the answer before they tell you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Going forward I will definitely fallow these 4 steps in order to ask question effectively and get useful answers

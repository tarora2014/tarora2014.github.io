      If you look at English, French, and Spanish they all have Latin as its root language and are therefore related to one another. Similarly JavaScript and Ruby both are related languages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since Ruby and JavaScript are related, many of the things are similar in those languages. For example both languages are object oriented and shair looping structures like while, if and for statements.

      Ruby programming is much easier because you dont have to worry about defining types of variable, also you dont have to worry about ending a line with ";" as a seprate charater because each line aututomatically stands own its own.
    </p>

      When declairing a function/method in Ruby all you need to do is use "def" in front of the method. On the other hand if you want to use a function/method in JavaScript you need to type "function" before the function name. You also dont have to worry about the extra brackets and paranthesis.

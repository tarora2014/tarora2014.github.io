      The last major conflict, I was forced to confront, happened with my previous employer. I use to be on a technical analysis who was part of a team in-charge of the network connections and making sure the application was running without any issues.

      As part of my contract I was told that I would be working nights and weekends once or twice a month. I agreed to this arrangement but I did not expect that instead of working once or twice a month it would be two to three times a week. It was ok at first because I thought it would be only during the busy part of the year even though I did not get any compensation of working overtime. This however was not the case. I got upset after this happened for a month straight and I decided to confront my manager about the problem. He agreed with my situation and told me that he was in the same boat as me and that he would submit my complaint to the team director.

      The one thing I learned from this conflict situation was that I needed to speak up when I don't feel that something is right. I should have gone to my manager much before and I could have resolved my issues with what was expected of me. I also felt that I need to practice improving my volume when I speak so that I am better heard.

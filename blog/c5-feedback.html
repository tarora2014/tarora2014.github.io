      Pairing over a remote session was hard at first because I prefer working with people in person. I think that with time I am getting better at communicating with others. I think that the pairing sessions are a great way to learn how to code because it gives me the opportunity to look at a problem through someone else's eyes. The virtual pairing session is a great thing to learn especially since it is becoming a common practice to hold meeting remotely in the real world.

      The few things that I find frustrating is not having the person's body language. I personally use body language as a tool to see how my partners react to certain situations and then change my approach to make the most out of the pairing sessions. I am hoping that I get better at communicating over the internet with the help of DBC pairing sessions.

      After reading the feedback from my previous pairing sessions I am glad that gradually my pairing sessions had less problems with my communication skills. Initially when I got feedback that I am not doing so well with my commutation skills I took the challenge to talk more to my pair.

      During one of my pairing sessions someone suggested that I take the time and talk about the entire problem with my pair before coding. This is one thing I would like to working on my next pairing session.

      Giving someone feedback is a hard thing to do. As long as the problem was resolved in a timely manner and all people participating were respectful to others, I don't think that the pairing sessions was bad. It is because of this that I find myself having a hard time giving someone constructive feedback.

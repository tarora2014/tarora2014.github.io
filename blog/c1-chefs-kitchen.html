        Having to leave a decent paying job in order to participate in something that may or may not help in the future is a scary thought that some might even consider crazy. It makes me feel very nervous because of the unknown and potential risk but for the same reason I feel excited to see what is in store for me in the next 18 weeks and how I can use this experience to better myself not only as a programmer but as a person.

        Having the chance to enter a community where technology is a way of life for thousands of people is something that attracted me to DBC. I see myself engaging with unique individuals who have a passion to learn not only because they have to but because they want to.

        The expectations and impression of DBC I am coming in maybe too much to expect but I feel like this opportunity would help me become a better individual. When I first signed up with DBC I expected to learn a new technology like Ruby which would help me progress in the IT industry. After reading about the experiences of others I am expecting to come across a new way of life. Living and working so close to the tech industry will help mold me into something that a 4 year collage degree on the east coast could not give.

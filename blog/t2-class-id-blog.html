      The first time I came across Classes and ID's in HTML/CSS code I though they were the same thing. Most people do think that even though its not true!

      The basic function of both Classes and ID's is to help people creating website better define tags. Since there are only a hand full of tags such as "a, h1-6, p, div, section" amoung few more, it gives the creator better and exact ways to difine these tags in order to change its properties using CSS. 

      The only and biggest difference between Classes and ID's is that the same class can be used multiple times in the HTML code. Just think about a class in a elementry school. There are many students in 1 class ex: Bob, Sarah, Tim, Jon ...etc. So that one class can be used by many students at the same time. On the other hand if you look at ID's, they are unique and therefore only 1 ID can exist for each student. Therefore ID's are more specific but are used for the same function as the class.

      Some of the common and best practices when it comes to using Classes or ID's is that we only use ID's when we are defining something that will only be used once.

      Some things that "Moscovitz" suggests you ask before you select Classes or ID's are :

        1) What function does the elements serve?

        2) Are there other elements that server similar functions?

        3) Are there other websites that use elements for the same purposes?

      If you are able to clearly define those three things you will be able to pick the correct choice between Classes and ID's.

        It's been 1 month since you have started your first job after collage. You are about to send your first program fix to your boss when you accidentally delete all your work. What should you do? Could you have prevented it? Most would think that this would situation would not happen to them, but its common that you would think. If you were using Version Control, you could just go and retrieve it.

        Most of us who have used any type of text editor like Microsoft Word or played a video game where after failing a level go back to a checkpoint have used some type of version control. When you accidentally remove a paragraph and click undo, you are using a form of version control. Any program that remembers what you have changed and lets you go back to some previous state is using version control.  
    </p>
    <p class="box_p">
        One option of version control is a tool called Git which can be installed on your own computer. This tool lets you save your progress as you work and keeps track of your project every time you same. So if you happen to start working on modifying a part of code and did not like where it was going, you would be able to use git and revert your changes.

        Now most people in the Tech industry work on very large programs that contain thousands of lines of code. The usually work on teams where multiple people need to access the same part of the code at the same time. Just imagine trying to change a copy of your code and then having to go back and compare with other who have made changes to the same file. This would be a nightmare for anyone developer. With the help of GitHub, your team can have a one main version of working code that is always evolving. GitHub lets uses create a tree structure where the main (root) code can be copied multiple times (like branches of trees) and then when its working can be merged back to main code. With the use of GitHub you have advantage of having multiple versions of code with the ability to choose which version you want to go with.
